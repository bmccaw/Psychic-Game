Psychic Game

Currently Working:
====================
 - Computer randomly guesses letter on page load
 - User guess is registered on key up
 - When user guesses correctly, win counter increases by 1
 - When user guesses incorrectly, guess is displayed under 'Letters guessed' and 'Guesses left' decreases by 1 (starts at 10)
 - When 'Guesses left' reaches zero, loss counter increases by 1
 
Current Bugs:
==================
 - ~~User can press keys that are not letter and these are added to the 'Letters guessed' area~~ SOLVED!
 - ~~When win condition fires, letters guessed does not reset and correct guess is added to the list for the next round~~ SOLVED!
 - ~~Pressing the same letter multiple times exhausts guesses even if it's not reflected on the screen~~ SOLVED!
